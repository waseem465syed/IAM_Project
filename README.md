Project Brief
Created IAM Users and Groups
* Developer group & users
* Operations group & users
* Finance group & users
* Analyst group & users

![Design Architecture Diagram](images/design.webp)



Team Structure & Access Needs: 
*   4 Developers (need EC2 and S3 access)
*  2 Operations (need full infrastructure access)
*  2 Finance Manager (needs cost management access)
*  3 Data Analysts (need read-only access to data resources)

Secure Storage of Root Credentials: The root account credentials were securely stored following AWS best practices, accessible only in break-glass scenarios.



￼


Set Up Security Requirements
* Enable MFA for all users
* Create a strong password policy
* Ensure users can only access what they need

🔰 Project Kick-Off: Cloud Security Hardening Initiative
🎯 Primary Objectives:
* 🔒 Secure the AWS Root Account and restrict its usage strictly to emergency scenarios
* 👥 Establish a comprehensive IAM framework with:
    * Individual users
    * Role-based groups
    * Least privilege access policies
* 🏗️ Redesign and implement a resilient and secure AWS infrastructure
* 📦 Introduce Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to manage IAM resources in a consistent, auditable, and scalable way
* 🛡️ Enforce foundational security controls such as:
    * Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    * Strong password policies

￼


✅ Provisioned a new IAM user with administrative privileges to eliminate reliance on the AWS root account for daily operations

Establishing Fine-Grained Access Control with IAM
A critical component of this project was to design and implement a scalable IAM architecture rooted in the principle of least privilege — ensuring that each user receives only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job responsibilities.
Key actions included:
* 🧩 Defined role-based IAM groups to simplify permission management and promote operational governance
* 👥 Created separate IAM groups for each functional team, including:
    * Developers

    * Operations
    * Finance
    * Data Analysts
